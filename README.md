# InGameCommandConsole
 i wanna make a simple system for capturing console commands in game for doing cheat codes and other debug tools.
 
 i have a basic command parser that does a handful of basic commands. might see if i can make it something that's easier to extend to add more commands to. i'd really like to see if i can someday figure out how to make it work more like the discord bot stuff i was doing in c#. so you tag functions to have them register as commands. no idea how i'd make that work though at this point.
 
 also right now it requires https://github.com/sophiathekitty/MessageDisplay for displaying the command log. some day i'd like to figure out a good way of having it automatically detect if packages are available and using fallbacks if they're not.
